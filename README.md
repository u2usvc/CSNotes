## About

### Introduction

Usually documentation (if any) of certain utilities and applications is too verbose and there is no indication whether certain information has higher priority and/or is used more often. Furthermore, when you attempt to use the technology, it often fails to work as described under the given conditions.

Because of this I've decided to create this repository to document tested techniques and practical usage examples for different types of technology I come across in a form of quick references.

### Development

This is very far from being complete: I will be slowly populating this repository with content from my local notes, I have lots of things to share.
